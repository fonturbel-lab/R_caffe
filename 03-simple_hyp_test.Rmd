## Simple hypothesis test in R

Now that we have the basic principles of creating and operating objects in R, as well as making some pretty nice graphics, now let's get started with statistics in R. Now we will start with some basic hypothesis testing by comparing the means of two or more treatments (groups).

```{r packages}
library(ggplot2)
library(ggthemes)
library(tidyr)
library(dplyr)
library(gapminder)
library(scales)
library(ggsci)
library(vegan)

source("multiplot.R")
```
