## How to analyze species composition?

Dealing with biodiversity data is somewhat different than dealing with the usual stuff that we are used to. .

```{r data}
library(confintr)

data<-read.csv("data/08_enzactivity.csv", header = T, sep = ",")
attach(data)
head(data)
```

aaaa


## Final thoughts

Linear regression and correlation are our entryway to understand linear relationships among linear variables. Linear regression allows us to assess the causal relationship between two continuous variables, whereas correlation examines association between a pair of variables without implying a causal relationship.
